        From the moment coding was first introduced to me in elementary school,
        I knew I had found my passion. I was mesmerized watching a programmer
        demonstrate how lines of code could control sprites to simulate an Angry
        Birds game. In that moment, my desire to master this magical power was
        ignited. I jumped at every opportunity to build on my newfound passion.
        In high school, I eagerly enrolled in programming electives where my
        skills progressed by leaps and bounds. I relished challenges like using
        code to direct robots through mazes and compete in races. My curiosity
        led me to experiment on my own time as well. I created web apps, dove
        deep into data structures and HTML/CSS through an AP course, and even
        managed to take the same class twice undetected because I couldn't get
        enough. Driven by curiosity, I branched into mobile game development and
        published my first 2D multiplayer shooter at just 17 years old. Though
        From an early introduction to coding in elementary school, I discovered
        my passion for programming. Watching a programmer control sprites in an
        Angry Birds simulation sparked my desire to master coding. Throughout
        high school, I eagerly took programming electives, tackled challenges
        like directing robots, and experimented with web apps, data structures,
        and HTML/CSS. My curiosity led me to mobile game development, and at 17,
        I published my first 2D multiplayer shooter. Despite initial rejection
        from the Play Store due to my age, I resubmitted on my 18th birthday,
        successfully launching my app. I expanded my skills to backend
        technologies, building comprehensive web applications. Now, as a CS
        Major, I continue to pursue my passion with the same enthusiasm, driven
        by the milestones I've achieved and the lessons I've learned. My journey
        has just begun, and I am excited to grow further into the software
        engineer I've always aspired to be.
